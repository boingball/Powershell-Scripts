#Added Function to allow this to be used with NCentral with Scripting 
#- When run it will ping all computers in the last subnet, use the ARP table to build a list of Computer Name / MAC Addresses from the Ping response
#- It then passes this to NSLookup to build a computer list table
#- Finally it then passes all these MAC addresses from the computers to the Invoke-WakeOnLan

#Lets check what network I'm on and set that as the Subnet
